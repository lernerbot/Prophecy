Unlike many magical effects which depend on obscure knowledge, expensive boxes, or years of practice, The Prophecy is an illusion that can be performed by beginners to experts and requires nothing more than a solid day or two of practice. Wherever you go, as long as you have The Prophecy installed on your iPhone, you&rsquo;ll be ready to perform an on-the-spot miracle in the eyes of your acquaintances.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Below you&rsquo;ll find everything you need to start creating powerful audio-based illusions on the fly, including scripts, tips, and other </span><span class="c3">bits of business</span><span>. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p><a href="#" name="id.2s76ctynzbv"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Effect</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>The performer confidently introduces him, or herself, to a new acquaintance. Upon hearing the name of his conversation partner (let&rsquo;s imagine it&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lisa&rdquo;) the performer&rsquo;s eyes widen. He explains that only days earlier he had received a premonition that he would meet someone soon named Lisa. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lisa seems skeptical. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>He continues: to prove that the feeling was genuine, he made a voice memo - which the performer promises to play shortly. First, Lisa is directed to freely state any 3 digit number. Lisa states 227 (great show from the 80&rsquo;s). This number is verified by the performer, who announces that he knew this would be her number. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lisa remains skeptical. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>The performer fairly activates/unlocks his phone and navigates to the Apple Voice Memos app. There, among the other files is a recording made exactly two days prior, as verified by the time stamp. He presses play. Everyone hears the following: &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s early in the morning. I have a feeling I&rsquo;m going to meet someone named Lisa later in the week, and I&rsquo;m going to attempt to make Lisa think of the number 227. Thank you&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>The acquaintance is at a loss.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Performer smiles, and segues into more mentalism, or simply a getting-to-know-you conversation with a new friend. This process is repeated ad infinitum. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p><a href="#" name="id.qj6ela5jvm3c"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Explanation</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Ok, so how does it work? The secret is that you are making a </span><span class="c3">live edit</span><span>. In other words, you&rsquo;re secretly making the recording right under the noses of the spectators. That means that this effect is nearly 100% impromptu. All you&rsquo;ll need to do is open The Premonition, and then through careful scripting, and practiced timing, you&rsquo;ll be able to pass words, phrases, and possibly sentences right past a spectator such that when they hear the recording moments later, they will not recall hearing you say most of the words in the recording. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>It sounds daunting, but we&rsquo;re going to break it down to give you the best chance of mastering the mechanics of this routine. Plus, The Premonition has some special built-in features to help increase your chance of success by throwing spectators off the scent, and increase the likelihood of completely fooling your audience. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Let&rsquo;s start with the basic script that you&rsquo;ll be using. When you combine the text below, and time the recording process properly, you will be performing miracles.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p><a href="#" name="id.grjhoi09olx"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Script</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span>It&rsquo;s a real pleasure to meet you. My name is Ron, and you are? Lisa? No way?! A few days ago I was sitting in a cafe, early in the morning, when I was struck with this thought - I have a feeling that I&rsquo;m going to meet someone named Lisa in the next few days, and I&rsquo;m going to attempt to make an audio recording, in case I actually meet Lisa, so that I have proof that I predicted this, and she won&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m crazy. So I&rsquo;ve gone ahead and made the recording - I have the proof, and I&rsquo;ll play the recording for you in just a moment, but for now I need you to think of the three-digit number that comes to mind first. Now change that to a new three-digit number. What is it? 227? That&rsquo;s two hundred, and twenty seven? Do you think you came up with that number on your own or do you think I forced it on you in some way? Let&rsquo;s find out.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Practice saying that entire script a few times, but don&rsquo;t rush through it like you&rsquo;re reading an article or a speech. Practice sounding natural. Imagine an actual person in front of you, visualize them nodding their heads in agreement with certain phrases, raising their eyebrows at certain claims. Speak one or two beats slower than your natural inclination. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Below, is the same text, but you&rsquo;ll find the key recording passages have been bolded for clarity and convenience. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s</span><span>&nbsp;a real pleasure to meet you.

Let&rsquo;s find out.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>In a nutshell, you only need to record the bolded phrases, and none of the other spoken words, to create the illusion of a genuine premonition.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p><a href="#" name="id.rzkhmumupj7j"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The App</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>So how does one go about making the recording with the app? When you opened the app for the first time, you saw a dark screen that prompted you to come to the Settings page. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Moving forward, you will always be able to access the Settings page by selecting from within that same exact region of your screen, even after you&rsquo;ve loaded your custom images. </span></p><p class="c1"><span>In addition to providing access to these Instructions, the Settings page is where you will load your 2 custom screen images (Home and Lock). </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Loading these images is a critical step in creating a compelling illusion. &nbsp;Take a screencap of your iPhone&rsquo;s home screen by pressing the home button, and lock button at the same time. The resulting image will go to your camera roll, and you will be able to find and select it from within The Premonition. The app CANNOT be used until you have loaded this photo.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Moving forward, each application launch will immediately bring you to this image, where you&rsquo;ll continue to find access to the recordings and settings page in the upper corners. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>In addition to loading your home screen image, you should take this opportunity to load a Lock Screen image as well. This should be the same image you currently use on your phone. If you cannot find that image for one reason or another, it is highly recommended that you change your actual Lock Screen image at this time to a new photo, and use that same image here in the Premonition. The importance of this feature will be explained a bit further on in these notes. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Another quick tip for now is to save both the images you&rsquo;ll be using as Favorites within your iPhone&rsquo;s Photos App. This will make accessing them in The Premonition much easier.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Here are the additional features you will find access to in the Settings page:</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Name of Recording</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>The Premonition allows you to assign a name to your secret recording. By default all recordings made on the app front page (as opposed to those made on the actual recording screen), will contain the day of the week that corresponds to your manually selected offset so if you&rsquo;re performing on a Saturday, with a value of 1 in the </span><span>&ldquo;Days Back&rdquo; </span><span>cell, then your recording will automatically begin with the word &ldquo;Friday&rdquo;. You can set additional text to appear beside the Day of Week value. So for instance, entering &ldquo;Premonition&rdquo; in the Name of Recording cell would result in &ldquo;Friday Premonition&rdquo; being the name of your recording. You can, of course, refer to your location in the name as well, either by putting the generic term &ldquo;cafe&rdquo; into the cell (before &ldquo;premonition&rdquo; for example), or you could even be specific, and name a cafe that is local to you, or in any other way relevant, and this can further enhance the illusion.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">How Many Days Back?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Recall that the premise of the illusion is that you predicted this chance encounter in the past. It is up to you to decide how far in the past that date is. Whatever value you select in the drop down menu, will result in an automatic offset to the time-stamp associated with your recording. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>From the app home page, selecting the block in the upper left area of the screen will bring you to your Recordings Page. There you&rsquo;ll find all the previously created and saved recordings. This page has been made to resemble the native Apple Voice Memos app as closely as possible to really sell the illusion that no special apps have been used in the performance of this effect. Here you will not only be able to initiate playback, but you can initiate new recordings on this page that will contain time marks, and a spectrogram that highly resemble the look and feel of the genuine app.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Note: All recordings will playback in Speaker mode. There is no way to change this setting at this time. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Selecting the speaker icon in the top right of your screen will bring you back to the recordings page. It will also, reset the effect so any files which still contain the default name structure, will be lost at this point.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span><br></span><a href="#" name="id.f3fuffb9cuhe"></a><span class="c0">Recording Mode</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>From the app home screen, all you need to do to begin recording is to touch the home screen. Once pressed, the recording will initiate and the screen will mostly go black. From here until you mark the recording as finished, the screen will only contain minimal text while the recording is in progress, and will fade to black otherwise. This powerful feature means that you can essentially show your phone as inactive while the trick is being performed. As long as you keep the screen relatively shielded during the actual recording, your spectators will not realize that your phone is even activated. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Generally speaking, it&rsquo;s advisable to touch the screen and fade to black before beginning to deliver any actual script. This is because there is sometimes a delay between the initial press of the home page screen and the actual beginning of the recording. From the black screen, there is less chance of a delayed start. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>If there are spectators around you at the time you decide to perform this effect, and therefore someone may be watching your hands and screen as you set-up, here is a helpful ruse to hide your intent: </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Navigate to the place on your phone where The Premonition icon resides - do not put it on your iPhone home screen but rather on one of the subsequent screens. Launch the app. As soon as the App home screen is visible (this should look like the clone of your home screen but with text and box outlines in the upper corners), mime the action of pressing the screen lock button on the side of your phone. At the same exact moment, touch the screen to make it go black. Timed properly, it will merely look like you&rsquo;ve fiddled with your phone for a moment, and then turned it off. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Once recording has begun, there is only one section of the screen you cannot touch until you are finished with the recording phase of the trick - the bottom right section of the phone, just above your home button, is reserved as the part of your phone meant to switch from the Recording mode, into the Playback mode. The invisible area encompassing the Finish button is exactly as large as the &ldquo;Recordings&rdquo; and &ldquo;Settings&rdquo; buttons on the home page. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Note that during recording, you CANNOT access the Recordings or Settings page. In fact, touching those parts of the screen during the Recording mode will result in capturing audio. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Because The Premonition does not rotate, you can keep the app in your pocket during performance, and bank on the fact that the finish button will always be close to the iPhone&rsquo;s home button. Stay away from that region - approximately one and half times larger than your bottom right-hand icon - until your ready to play your full recording, and you&rsquo;ll be golden. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p><a href="#" name="id.9oqc4m8ph7d8"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Playback Mode</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Once you&rsquo;ve completed your recording, it&rsquo;s time to introduce the phone and the recording you made all those days ago. Of course, you are never really leaving The Premonition, so we&rsquo;ve built a sequence that perfectly mimics the process of activating your phone and navigating to the Voice Memos app. Here&rsquo;s how it works: </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Upon hitting the Finish button, the app will show a black screen, once again, imitating an inactive handset. To go to your recordings, you must first activate the phone. On an iPhone, this means hitting the Home button. However, as you cannot actually hit the home button (or you&rsquo;ll leave the app), you must mimic the action of hitting the phone button while actually touching the region of the phone directly above the home button. This is like the action you may have used at the beginning to get yourself into black screen. Only now you are mimicking the flip side of that process.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>DO NOT HIT THE HOME BUTTON</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Once you&rsquo;ve secretly touched the region of your phone screen directly above the Home button, you&rsquo;ll be greeted by the image you uploaded in the Lock Screen area of your Settings page. That photo will be altered to look exactly like your Lock Screen would in this exact context. You will note the current time at the top of the screen, along with a &ldquo;slide to unlock&rdquo; cell near the bottom. Slide to unlock the phone.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Note that The Premonition currently does not support a number lock screen. For maximum deceptiveness, do not perform this effect for spectators who may have seen you actually unlock your phone, as you may use a number lock sequence and sharp-eyed spectators may notice the discrepancy in performance. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Once the phone has been activated and unlocked, you will see the image of your Home screen which was loaded into the Settings page. There is only one app icon that you can actually select at this moment, and that is the one in your upper left-hand corner. </span><span>For that reason, </span><span class="c3">you should place your Apple Voice Memos app icon into that location before taking the screenshot of your home page and loading it into the Settings Page. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>After you&rsquo;ve selected the false Voice Memos icon, the app will load. We have gone to great lengths to make this a replica of the app you have pre-installed on your phone. Not every function has been recreated, but you can create brand new recordings from this screen and see the same hash marks, spectrogram, and time counter as you&rsquo;ve come to expect in your native app. You may never need to use this recording feature, but it&rsquo;s nice to have, and can be a handy convincer to a skeptical audience that you are where you say you are.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p><a href="#" name="id.kmsrxe55sj9s"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Intonation</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>For the script and the recording to come out come out properly, you&rsquo;re going to need to say the relevant target phrases with very precise intonation, otherwise your recording may end up sounding like a patchwork of different clips - which of course, is precisely what it is!</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>There are several general rules of thumb that we can present here. First,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span></span></p></body></html>
